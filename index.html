                <p>With the standing shelter-in-place order in NY state, extra time seems to come a little extra in
                    abundance these days. To
                    turn this into a positive exprience, I've decided to create this website to make productive use of
                    my time. I've done some web programming
                    in college, but front-end development was never really ever considered important beyond
                    functionality, so this website will be
                    focused on creating something fun and exciting. Since this is just visual, front-end focused, I will
                    only be using plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript
                    to develop everything you see on this page. To keep things fresh I will use this as a blog for my
                    daily life and goals, as well as try to put out at least
                    weekly regular UI updates to slowly progress through things. Time to make my #CovidGoals a reality.
