                    The second element I worked on is the navigation bar. 
                    If you hover over the "About" section, it creates a sliding drawer effect to show the sub menus.
                    I thought this was a little more fun than your typical dropdown menu that appears.
                    This is done completely through CSS flex display and animations.
                    The whole header is a flex element with evenly sized elements for each menu item.
                    The about element is its own flex element with the about header, and two submenu items.
                    The about selection is given flex of 1, and the submenu gets flex 0, and add on hidden overflow then the submenu gets hidden away.
                    The final step is to add an animation on hover. 
                    When the mouse hovers over the about tab, the flex value of the submenu is changed to 1 so that they take up equal space and pop out of hiding.
                    The CSS Transition gives it the smooth gradual change.

            <div class="post-body">
                <p>So the first piece I added to the site is the header design for the home page. 
                    The angled line effect is created through two layed Div elements one topof each other.
                    The top layer makes up the center section, which uses a CSS clip-path to angle out the corners of the header.
                    The bottom layer beneath that is simply just a full size rectangle.
                    Each layer then got a different gradient direction to create a color contrast at the edges where the elements meet.
                    This gives it that stark contrast line between the two elements.

                <p>With the standing shelter-in-place order in NY state, extra time seems to come a little extra in
                    abundance these days. To
                    turn this into a positive exprience, I've decided to create this website to make productive use of
                    my time. I've done some web programming
                    in college, but front-end development was never really ever considered important beyond
                    functionality, so this website will be
                    focused on creating something fun and exciting. Since this is just visual, front-end focused, I will
                    only be using plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript
                    to develop everything you see on this page. To keep things fresh I will use this as a blog for my
                    daily life and goals, as well as try to put out at least
                    weekly regular UI updates to slowly progress through things. Time to make my #CovidGoals a reality.</p>
