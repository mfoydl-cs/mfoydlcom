                turn this into a positive exprience, I've decided to create this website to make productive use of
                my time. I've done some web programming
                in college, but front-end development was never really ever considered important beyond
                functionality, so this website will be
                focused on creating something fun and exciting. Since this is just visual, front-end focused, I will
                only be using plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript
                to develop everything you see on this page. To keep things fresh I will use this as a blog for my
                daily life and goals, as well as try to put out at least
                weekly regular UI updates to slowly progress through things. Time to make my #CovidGoals a reality.</p>
