            So obviously Corona Virus won't last forever (Or at least I really hope not...), but for now I am calling this "CoronaGoals". If you read my initial blogpost,
            you can see that this is because I'm using the extra time from shelter-in-place to accomplish some goals that I've set for myself. The first of which is this website.
            Other goals will come into play on this site as general blog like posts on the home page, so check back every once in a while if you're bored and curious, and see the 
            site develop over time. Everything shall update in time, just needed some content to get things up and running! Thanks for reading.
